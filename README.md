### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I am a fresher in coding .My current project is a virtual voice assistant, it's main goal is to take voice commands and perform tasks. 
Right now it's very basic and can only perform simple tasks but my plan is to add more functions and make it versatile for different tasks.
In simple terms my code has a speech recognition system which listens to the users sentence and targets certain keywords to give an output.
My future plans are to add a ui to the code making it appealing to watch.

I also plan to create some websites with javascript,html, css.
